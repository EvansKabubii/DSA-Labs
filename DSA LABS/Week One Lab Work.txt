Question 1

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Char signed
 char Char1=-128;
 char Char2=-129;

// Char Unsigned
char Char3= 255;
char Char4=256;

// Short signed
short short1=-32768;
short short2=-32769;

//Short Unsigned
short short3=65535;
short short4=65536;

//Int signed
int int1=-2147483648;
int int2=-2147483649;

//Int unsigned
int int3=4294967295;
int int4=4294967296;

 cout<<Char1<<Char2<<Char3<<Char4<<short1<<short2<<short3<<short4<<int1<<int2<<int3<<int4;
}

Question 2

The output to the code is:
“5 10 
2 4 6 8 10 
 “
This output came to be by essentially outputting the values of 2 arrays one after another.
The arrays were output by using a function called “printarray”. This function takes an array
and creates a counter that allows the array to output its elements one by one using a for loop
that is stopped by the counter.
